Hi! My name is Savely Petropavlovskiy. I am a software developer and am new to the IT field. I have experience with Python, object-oriented programming (OOP), Git and Linux.

I have development skills in Python and am familiar with its various libraries and frameworks. I apply OOP principles to create modular and scalable code.

I am also familiar with the Git version control system, which allows me to efficiently manage and track changes to code. I use Git to collaborate with the development team and version control projects.

I have experience in the Linux environment and am familiar with the basic commands and tools that help me work effectively in this operating system.

I am currently learning the C programming language to expand my skills and understanding of low-level systems operation. In addition, I am also learning SQL to work with databases and improve my skills in data storage and retrieval.

I am keen to progress in the IT field and am continuously learning new technologies and tools and am actively learning algorithms and data structures now.
